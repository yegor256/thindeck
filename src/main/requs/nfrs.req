UC1/SEC must "uniquely identify users and enable their
  login and logout operations, through secure HTTPS protocol".

UC1/UX must "expose user interface in English only".

UC1/WD must "be designed in 'responsive' manner, see
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design . Since all Thindeck
  site pages will look good on every device, we won't need a separate
  mobile version of the site".

UC1/STL must "require all user repositories to be 100% stateless.
  We should inform users that we will be constantly changing the number
  of running containers. We may terminate any container at any moment.
  This means that the software inside the container (repository) should
  NOT keep any data persistent. They should use other services for
  persistence, like Amazon DynamoDB, etc".

UC1/API must "expose all features, which are available through UI,
  through RESTful API".

UC1/FIN must "present total summary of consumed resources to the
  user in a table with these columns: Container (id), Inbound traffic (Gb),
  Outbound traffic (Gb), CPU time (min), Cost ($).
  Each table row corresponds to a container. Last row contains
  totals by all containers. The values in the table are usage stats by container
  within specified time interval".

UC2/PERF must "each physical server should be able to host 4 actively working
  containers inside it, altogether handling 3M hits and 200 Gb of traffic
  per month, or 100K and 6.6 Gb per day".

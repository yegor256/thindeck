UC1 where User (a user) hosts Repository (a repo):
    1. The user registers the repo;
    2. The repo deploys itself;
    3. The user reads deployment logs of the repo;

    key as "a private SSH key, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography".

Repository includes:
    deployment-s? as Deployment.

Deployment is "a result (plain text log) of a Docker container start".

Manifest is "a YAML configuration file, stored in the repository, and
    includes a) list of domain names, b) list of open ports.".

    the latest version of the source code. Besides Dockerfile, which is used
    for the Docker container, we should look for a Manifest of the repository.
    According to the informaiton in the Manifest we should configure the
    container after its start. While the repository is used, we should
    track its CPU and traffic consumption, and assign to its owner".

a7df74:UC4 is specified.
a7df74:UC4 is a must.
UC4 where User reads deployment logs of Repository:
    "The user clicks his repository and opens a page with a list

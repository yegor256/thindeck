    3. The system creates User(a user);
    4. The system "adds $5 to the user.balance";

    key as "a private SSH key, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography".

Repository includes:
    deployment-s? as Deployment.

Deployment is "a summary statistics of Containers related to a Repository, with their statuses and text logs".

Deployment includes:
    container-s as Container.

Container is "a virtual operating system running a Repository".

Manifest is "a YAML configuration file, stored in the repository, and
    includes a) list of domain names, b) list of open ports.".

UC1/1 when "repo already exists":
    1. Fail since "a message that the repository exists already in his account".

:UC2 is specified.

UC2 where User registers Repository:
    1. The user "enters a new unique name of the repository, its URI and an optional SSH key and confirms entered data";
    2. The system "adds the Repository and displays it in the list of other repositories in the user account".

UC2/1 when "data is incorrect":
    1. Fail since "repository cannot be registered".

433912:UC3 is specified.
433912:UC3 is a must.
UC3 where Repository deploys itself:
    "We fetch the repository every five minutes and check the difference
    between existing source code and the latest version. If there are
    any changes, we stop its Docker container, and start a new one with
    the latest version of the source code. Besides Dockerfile, which is used
    for the Docker container, we should look for a Manifest of the repository.
    According to the informaiton in the Manifest we should configure the
    container after its start. While the repository is used, we should
    track its CPU and traffic consumption, and assign to its owner".

:UC4 is specified.
:UC4 is a must.
UC4 where User reads deployment logs of Repository:
    1. The user "requests a list of deployments for the Repository";

UC5 where User(a user) reads usage stats using Repository(a repo):
    1. The user "selects a time interval, like: last 7 days, last month, custom (from date, to date)";
    2. The system "reads usage records corresounding to the repo within specified time interval";
    3. The system "shows the user a table with these columns: Container (id), Inbound traffic (Gb),
    Outbound traffic (Gb), CPU time (min), Cost ($). Each table row corresponds to a container.
    Last row contains totals by all containers. The values in the table are usage stats by container
    within specified time interval".

cc7e07:UC6 is specified.

This document specifies architecture and design decisions made in relation to
the Thindeck.com project.

Section 2 lists basic assumptions made after investigation of the provided
business case description. Section 3 includes class diagrams showing the
packaging and class design. Section 4 explains separation of software
components, and the interaction between them and third-parties.
Section 5 describes a proposed physical layout of the major tiers of the
system under development (SuD). Section 6 gives internal details of major use
case implementations. Section 7 lists the three most severe technical risks
identified, analyzed, and planned. Section 8 lists all important technical
decisions made during architecture and design.

## 2. Assumptions

To be continued...

> @todo #1/DES The specification is still rather vague for now. I haven't written
>  any assumptions here just yet. Let's write them down here as they come up.

## 3. Class diagrams

The classes that comprise the data model and their relationships are documented
in the [Software Requirements Specification](/requs/requs.xml).

To be continued...

> @todo #261/DES Our data model class diagrams are now generated by Requs and
>  included in the SRS. But, we also need to show the classes and interfaces
>  that involve the other parts of the system, e.g. API infrastructure,
>  UI classes, data persistence classes, etc.
> @todo #1/DES Let's define the packaging structure of Thindeck. Describe the
>  purposes of each package, the classes and resources that they contain, etc.
>  Include a diagram showing how they are all related.

## 4. Component View

There is a dedicated article for [Component View]({% post_url 2014/jun/2014-06-24-component-view %}).

## 5. Deployment View

There is a dedicated article for [Deployment View]({% post_url 2014/jun/2014-06-27-deployment-view %}).

## 6. Use Cases, Sequence Diagrams

Use Cases and their associated Sequence Diagrams can be found in the
[Software Requirements Specification](/requs/requs.xml).

## 7. Technical Risks

To be continued...

> @todo #1/DES We need to identify the risks associated with this project. Let's
>  document those risks in this section.

## 8. Decisions Made

To be continued...

> @todo #1/DES Let's document the architectural and design decisions in this
>  section.
